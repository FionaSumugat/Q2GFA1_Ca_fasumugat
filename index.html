        <p> According to IUCN, around 14 million tons of plastic are found in the ocean every year. This affects the living conditions of not only us humans, but also of the marine animals, with 100 million of them dying every year due to plastic. Ocean pollution has been getting more evident and millions of lives have been taken in the process. Therefore, we must act now. This advocacy strives to inform people of ways to save our ocean. Let us work hand-in-hand to make our world a better place. Join now and <u>be part of the change. </u></p>
